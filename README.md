# Word-Guess-Game

The goal of this game assignment was to make a game similar in aspect to a Hangman Game. I made a theme based on animals to guess and I love weird animals so some of the guesses are a little obscure.

Press any key to begin. You're trying to get the full animal name without losing all seven of your lives. Don't worry if you accidentally press a number or weird character, the game only accepts letters!

It keeps tracks track of your wins and losses so try to get as many wins as you can.

Good luck!
